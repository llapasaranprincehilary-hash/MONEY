  {h:'Needs vs wants',p:'Needs keep life running: food, fare to school, bills, load for class. Wants are nice to have: milk tea runs, new skins, extra shoes.',ex:'Some things are both. A phone for school is a need. The newest model is a want.'},

  {h:'Pay yourself first',p:'Move your savings the moment money arrives, before you spend. Saving "whatever is left" usually means saving nothing.'},

  {h:'A sale is not savings',p:'A 50% discount on something you did not plan to buy is still money spent. A discount only saves you money on things you already needed.'},
  {h:'Pay later is still pay',p:'Installments and pay-later options make things feel cheaper because the cost is spread out. Each payment is a real bill. Add it to your budget the day you sign up, and check for fees.'},
  {h:'Compare before you pay',p:'Check prices in two places and watch the small fees: transfer fees, delivery fees, cash-in fees. They quietly add up.'}],

  {h:'Minimum payments are a trap',p:'Paying only the minimum keeps the balance alive longer and costs far more in interest. When you can, pay more than the minimum.'},
  {h:'Credit cards: stay light',p:'A common guideline is to use less than about 30% of your limit, and to pay the full statement on time.',ex:'On a ₱20,000 limit, 30% is ₱6,000.'},
  {h:'Utang to friends and apps',p:'Write down every utang with the date and amount, even with friends. For lending apps, check that the lender is registered with the SEC, read the total cost, and be wary of any app that asks for your contacts or uses pressure.'}],
